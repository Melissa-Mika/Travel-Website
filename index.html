                <p class="wranglertext">A wrangler is someone who is involved in the process of taming, controlling, and
                handling various animals. In this case, the wrangler experience involves horses found on the ranch.
                Many are
                not tamed and you will work with a professional wrangler in taming the horse of your choosing. Learn
                the
                process and feel that satisfaction as the horse begins to warm up to you. You also get to name your
                horse,
                and once fully tamed and trained, your horse will start working on the ranch giving horseback rides
                to
                people who request them. Otherwise, your horse will have several acres of land to run free and graze
                upon.
